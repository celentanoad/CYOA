Game Ideas:

Text based choose your own adventure?
Create an object w/ all the different choices, some lead back to others, maybe several different endings

Basic premise is you are a dragon, you hear of a princess who is trying to take over the world and dominate but she is evil so you want to stop her

Events that happen that help/affect the story:
You encounter a traveler who needs help, you can take time away from your journey to help him but then he decides to join you (which skips a quest later)

Have an inventory and certain events will check the inventory to see if the item is there- if it is then different choices will appear
